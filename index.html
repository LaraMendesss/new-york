<h2>Why New York?</h2>
<h3>New York, the city that never sleeps</h3>

<p>New York, or simply NYC, is the most populous city in the United States located at the southern tip of New York State on one of the world's largest natural harbors. 
    
    It is a global city and a cultural, financial, high-tech, entertainment, and media center with a significant influence on commerce, health care, scientific output, life sciences, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, dining, art, fashion, and sports. 
    Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy.
    It is sometimes described as the world's most important city and the capital of the world.</p>

<p>With a census-estimated population of 8,3 million distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2) in 2022, the city is the most densely populated major city in the United States. 

    As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. The city is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the U.S., the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016.</p>
